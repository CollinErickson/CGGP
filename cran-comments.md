I received an email on 8/19/23 from Kurt Hornik saying that I had to 
update the documentation for my package as specified in this bug:
https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/1491. I made the requested change.
Apologies for taking so long.

I ran CMD CHECK on all the following and had no issues.


## Test environments
* local Windows 11, R 4.3.2
* ubuntu 22.04 (on GitHub Actions), R 4.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub (Windows, Ubuntu Linux, Fedora Linux, Debian Linux)


## R CMD check results

On personal Windows 11 (1/19/24) there is 1 NOTE:
"Specified C++11: please drop specification unless essential"
I tried to drop the specification, but it caused an issue on one of the system
checks.

On R-hub (1/18/24) there are a few NOTEs, but no real issues.

On winbuilder (check_win_release, 1/19/24) it has 1 NOTE for the maintainer.

On winbuilder (check_win_devel, 1/18/24) it has 1 NOTE for the maintainer.

On GitHub Actions (1/17/24) there is 1 NOTE for C++11 as on Windows 11.


## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
