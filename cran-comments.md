I submitted a couple of weeks ago and was told to reduce the number
of tests/examples so it can build in under ten minutes.
I also made a couple of other changes.

## Test environments
* local Windows 7 install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.


## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
