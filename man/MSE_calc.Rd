\title{Calculate MSE over single dimension for Matern 3/2}
\usage{
MSE_calc(xl, theta, CorrMat)
}
\arguments{
\item{xl}{Vector of points in 1D}

\item{theta}{Log of correlation parameters.}

\item{CorrMat}{Function that gives correlation matrix for vectors of 1D points.}

\item{theta}{Correlation parameters}

\item{nugget}{Nugget to add to diagonal of correlation matrix.}

\item{diag_corrMat}{Function that gives diagonal of correlation matrix for vector of 1D points.}

\item{...}{Don't use, just forces theta to be named}
}
\value{
MSE value
}
\description{
Calcaluted using grid of integration points.
Can be calculated exactly, but not much reason in 1D.
}
\examples{
MSE_calc(xl=c(0,.5,.9), theta=1, nugget=.001,
         CorrMat=CorrMatMatern32,
         diag_corrMat=diag_corrMatMatern32)
